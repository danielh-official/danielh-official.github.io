title: Local Mutelist For x.com (Formerly Twitter)

I made a [chrome extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/local-xcom-twitter-muteli/epgpnmkhgjnhhammgaaencaconefiokp?hl=en&authuser=0) for hiding specific people's posts on x.com.

Unlike other extensions, the mute is local and can be exported and imported into your other profiles, allowing you to hide annoying people on all your accounts' timelines, whereas using X's native blocking or muting features only works for one account at a time.
