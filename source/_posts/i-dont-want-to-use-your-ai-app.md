I'm getting AI fatigue.

To be clear, I don't mind if your product uses AI for anything, but when all your ads and marketing leads with buzzwords like "AI-POWERED", my immediate gut reaction is to assume you have so little confidence in the quality of your product that you have to rely on these buzzwords to bait consumers into trying it out.

I don't want to use something that's AI-powered. I want to use something that works, and that I can see as being a necessary part of my toolkit for my daily survival.

If your app uses AI for natural language parsing, fine. But I'd rather that be a background feature than something shoved in my face.

Tell me more about how the app is well-suited for a use case that fits my (the intended demographic's) purpose. Tell me how it stacks against potential competition so I have a necessary (if not biased) bird's-eye view of the situation.
