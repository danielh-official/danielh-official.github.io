            ## Missing Categories Detected

            This PR was automatically created because new categories were found in blog posts that don't have corresponding category files.

            **Missing categories:** ${{ steps.check.outputs.missing_categories }}

            **Created files:** ${{ steps.check.outputs.created_files }}

            These category files have been generated with the standard template: 
            ```markdown
            ---
            extends:  _layouts.category
            title: [Category Name]
            ---
            ```
